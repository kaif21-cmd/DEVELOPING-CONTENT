TEAM PAGE 
A team page is an essential component of any business or organization's website. It provides visitors with an overview of the people who work for the company and the roles they play. A well-crafted team page can help create a connection between the business and its customers, giving a human face to the organization and increasing trust and confidence in its products or services.
