# FLIPPING CARD
If you are interested in creating a digital flipping card using HTML and CSS, you can do so with just a few lines of code. A flipping card is essentially a card that has two sides, with one side displaying the content and the other side showing additional information when flipped.

To create a flipping card using HTML and CSS, you can start by creating a div element with a class of "card". This will serve as the container for the card content. Within this div, you can create two more div elements with classes of "card-front" and "card-back". These will represent the front and back of the card, respectively.

Inside the "card-front" div, you can add the content that you want to display on the front of the card. This can include images, text, or any other HTML elements you want to use. Similarly, inside the "card-back" div, you can add the content that you want to display when the card is flipped over.

To add the flipping animation, you can use CSS transitions and transforms. You can add a transform property to the "card" class, with a value of "rotateY(180deg)". This will rotate the card 180 degrees when it is flipped over. You can also add a transition property with a value of "all 0.5s ease" to create a smooth animation.

It may also feature copyright information, social media icons, and other important legal notices. In addition, the footer page may contain a sitemap or a list of the website's pages, making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they are looking for.

One of the primary functions of the footer page is to provide users with easy access to important information about the website or business. By including links to legal notices and contact information, users can quickly and easily find the information they need to interact with the website or business.
